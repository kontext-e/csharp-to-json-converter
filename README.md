This Repository is a continuation of the work done by [Softvis Reasearch](https://github.com/softvis-research/csharp-to-json-converter)

For the [jQAssistant C# plugin](https://github.com/kontext-e/jqa-csharp-plugin) we use [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) to parse C# source code. This project is part of the plugin and is used to convert C# code to JSON which can then be processed by the [jQAssistant C# plugin](https://github.com/softvis-research/jqa-csharp-plugin).

The project is developed under [.NET v6.0.419](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0).

We tested on Windows 10 and 11
